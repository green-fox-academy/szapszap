// Create a prison function, that has your name as a private fugitive variable
// The function should return an object that has two methods:
//  - visit() // logs "[yourname] is visited [x] time(s)" to the console.
//    - the [x] times displayes the numbers the function is called
//    - If the fugitive variable is empty, then display "Nobody is here anymore"
//  - escape() // logs "BREAKING NEWS, [yourname] escaped the prison" to the console.
//    - it should empties the fugitive variable
