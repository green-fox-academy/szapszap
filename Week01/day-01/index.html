      		An ever-growing set of tools and technologies have helped developers build more dynamic and interactive websites. Further, web developers now help to deliver applications as web services which were traditionally only available as applications on a desk-based computer. I created this guide after realizing that there is a bit of a bottleneck during the learning stages for beginners. The amount of resources available is mind-boggling and as I like to say, we tend to be moving everywhere but going nowhere. What you can expect from this guide is a straightforward and easy to follow learning path to get you started in the world of code and web development.
